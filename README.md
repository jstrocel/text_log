# Text Log

This a small text logging app I use to track what's going on in my workday without having to write those pesky timestamps. It writes a textfile to the MyJournal Directory in your home directory (Wherever that may be on your system). Type a sentence, hit send, and that entry appears timestamped in a text file. 1 text file is created per day.
